# 👋 Hello there

It's now possible to contribute to JS and Web Developer LinkedIn pages by posting awesome memes:

Feel free to share your ideas.

_Unfortunately and due to the purpose of those pages, I would never share any kind of promotion at this point._

### 🎆 Propose a meme

It's simple as [opening a new issue](https://github.com/devpolo/community/issues/new/choose).

### ⭐️ Give this project a star

It may not seem like much, but it really makes a difference. This is something that everyone can do to help out.
